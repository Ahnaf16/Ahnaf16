# Hi

## I'm Ahnaf Sakil Mahmud

I'm create modern, reactive apps using **Flutter** for Android and iOS. I prefer **Riverpod** for my State Management solution. I'm experienced in both Frontend and Backend development. **Firebase** is my preferred backend. I also have experience with **RestApi**, third-party SDKs: Bkash, Strip etc.
